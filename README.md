## **🌟 About the Project**

The Manga Recommendation System suggests manga titles tailored to the user's taste, similar to Netflix or MyAnimeList.

* **Guest Users:**
  Get instant recommendations using **Content-Based Filtering (CBF)** based on manga descriptions and genres.

* **Logged-in Users:**
  Ratings are collected and used to power **Collaborative Filtering (CF)** for personalized suggestions.

* **Hybrid Model:**
  Combines both approaches to deliver highly accurate results by blending user behavior and content similarity.

* **Dynamic Dataset Updates:**
  Fetches the latest manga data automatically through APIs, ensuring the recommendations stay relevant.

---

## **🚀 Features**

* 🔹 Content-Based Filtering using **TF-IDF** and **Cosine Similarity**.
* 🔹 Collaborative Filtering with **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**.
* 🔹 Hybrid approach combining both for Netflix-like accuracy.
* 🔹 **Guest Onboarding Flow** for instant recommendations without signup.
* 🔹 Secure authentication using **Flask-Login**.
* 🔹 Dynamic backend designed for scalability and dataset updates.

## **💡 How It Works**

The recommendation system works in three layers:

### **1. Content-Based Filtering (CBF)**

* Uses **TF-IDF** on manga **genres** and **synopsis**.
* Similarity between mangas is calculated using **Cosine Similarity**.
* Perfect for **new users with no rating history**.

---

### **2. Collaborative Filtering (CF)**

* Uses **user ratings** to find hidden relationships.
* Implemented using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**.
* Generates recommendations by comparing a user's rating patterns with others.

---

### **3. Hybrid Model**

* **CBF** recommendations are filtered through **CF scores** for better accuracy.
* If a user has no ratings, **CBF alone** is used.

---

## **🧪 Example Use Case**

* **Guest User Flow:**

  * User visits the site → Instantly receives recommendations using CBF.
* **Registered User Flow:**

  * Logs in → Rates a few manga → Hybrid model kicks in for highly personalized recommendations.

## **🚀 Deployment**

The app is deployed on **Render** using **Gunicorn**.

### Start Command:

```
gunicorn wsgi:app
```

Make sure `gunicorn` is included in `requirements.txt`:

```
gunicorn>=20.1.0
```
